Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -8.953 ns between pad1/output_pixel_counter_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and pad1/img_x_index_reg[4]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#59 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.204 ns between pad1/output_pixel_counter_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and pad1/img_x_index_reg[3]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

There is a large setup violation of -9.534 ns between pad1/output_pixel_counter_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and pad1/img_x_index_reg[1]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.745 ns between pad1/output_pixel_counter_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and pad1/img_x_index_reg[2]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
